# Advent of Code 2020

The is the start of my AoC 2020.  It's in the Rust language as a way to
kickstart using Rust more frequently.  Rust joins Python, Bash and Haskell as
my current "in use" languages.

# Building

aoc202 needs a rust toolchain to build it.
[rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) is probably the easiest way to get it.
The stable channel is the one to use.

## Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. `cargo build --release`
3. run it with a day-part number (e.g. 1-2 is day 1, part 2)

# Using

TBA
